The Kulluk was being towed from Dutch Harbor to Seattle by the towing vessel Aiviq when it lost engine power, which caused the loss of the Kulluk. Although power was restored to the Aiviq, subsequent attempts at reattaching the tow were not successful, in part due to heavy weather. The Kulluk has on board approximately 144,000 gallons of diesel fuel and 16,000 gallons of lube oils and hydraulic fluid. Currently the Kulluk is sitting upright and there are no observable fuel leaks. The weather continues to remain rough, which is hampering attempts at salvage efforts and site visits. By Jan. 6 the weather was calmer and salvage crews had stabilized the drilling rig. As a result the Aiviq, connected by tow, was able to successfully refloat the Kulluk and began towing it to Kliuda Bay, 30 n.m. away.

The Coast Guard established a 500-yard safety zone and federal, state and local authorities allowed the vessel to burn due to concerns of the vessel sinking if firefighting activities continued. On Sunday, May 14, the Deep Sea unexpectedly sank with an unknown amount of diesel fuel on board. Oil skimming vessels placed oil containment boom around the area of the sunken vessel. The Coast Guard hired Ballard Diving & Salvage Co. to plug vents and seal the vesselâ€™s fuel tanks. However, a cracked vent allowed fuel to leak from the sunken vessel at an estimated rate of 2 gallons per minute. On May 14, some commercial shellfish operations in Penn Cove voluntarily stopped harvesting on before fuel reached nearby mussel rafts. The volume of diesel spilled from the boat grew through Monday, leaving a very thin coating of oil over the commercial operation, leading the Washington Department of Health to close the area. Recreational shellfish harvesting in Penn Cove was also temporarily closed. The oil sheen was too thin to remove from the water. Ecology has been monitoring shoreline areas for potential environmental effects from the spill. Some sheen had reached the shore in places. Ecology is analyzing water samples collected help evaluate environmental impacts from the spill. There have been no injured or killed mammals or fish observed or reported. The Washington Department of Natural Resources is developing options for salvaging the vessel. The Coast Guard has opened the federal Oil Spill Liability Fund to pay for response efforts. NOAA ERD has been requested to create trajectories for potential releases during salvage operations and to assist the WA State Department of Health in connecting to NOAA's Seafood Inspection Program for sensory testing." ;

The vessel crew has reported to the CG that there is some type of steering casualty and that the crew was not able to make repairs while they were underway. Shortly, thereafter, CG Sector Anchorage requested the SSC to initiate a SPOT weather forecast from the NWS. No spill has occurred. The vessel is a 656 ft long Singapore registered vessel with 23 crew members aboard. The USCG reports that the vessel's cargo is packaged lumber and that there are 227,000 gallons of bunker C oil and 60,000 gallons of diesel on board. As of Dec. 6, the vessel was drifting in a northwest direction away from land and is projected to continue to drift to the north for the next day. After flying in some Norwegian engineers - to Anchorage, Adak, and then via CG helo to the MV Morning Cedar - temporary repairs were accomplished on the rudder. This allowed the vessel a modicum of steerage, by using the bow thruster in conjunction with main engine and fixed rudder, to control the vessel and motor at a higher speed. Hence, the CG ordered the vessel to motor to Dutch Harbor, where it arrived on Sun. morning, Dec. 11, 2011, to make permanent vessel steerage repairs. The tug Guardsmen as well as the CGC Sherman will stand by until the CG has fully inspected and approved these repairs. Case Closed John Whitney, NOAA Alaska SSC" ;

At the sunken tug location of approximately 100 nm ESE of St. Paul and about 100 meters water depth, considerable concern was expressed by NMFS regarding the possible oiling of some of the thousands of foraging fur seals which habitat this area, from escaping diesel, even though a very large diesel release as the tug was actually documented by the crewmen from the tug after escaping onto the barge. On several occasions the RP very diligently attempted various modes, both by vessel and by air, to monitoring the occurrence of sheen on the surface nothing was ever noted.

On Feb. 16, 2010, Global Offshore Divers of Anchorage mobilized a three-man remote operated vehicle crew to Juneau in response to a request by the USCG, Sector Juneau's Incident management, to survey the wreck of this vessel. The survey lasted a total of three days from Feb. 17-19 with two ROV's, and the first entry in this Hotline is the Global Diving report from those surveys. After mobilization of equipment from Seattle, Global Diving tentatively hopes to start pumping oil on or about March 5.

Divers have reported sheens coming from the Coimbra for decades, but the article suggests that the leakage may be getting worse. Last Thursday, the USCG contacted Ed Levine, NOAA SSC for the region, to discuss the situation. It is expected that an interagency conference call will be held this week to determine whether an investigation to evaluate response options, is warranted. At the national level, ERD is developing an interagency agreement with the USCG under which the agencies will work together to address threats from vessels sunken off US shores that contain significant volumes of oil.

The barge has 72,000 gallons of gasoline and 72,000 gallons of Jet fuel. The barge is a 1968 single skin barge. The grounded barge had gone through two tidal cycles, during which the tug could not pull it off the bottom, prior to notifying CG Sector Anchorage on Sept. 17. No fuel has been released into the the environment. The CG requested that the NOAA SSC provide weather and tidal information. Shortly after the grounding a second barge, the OB-5, was summoned from Bethel 80 miles to the north. Barge OB-5 was able to liter 60,000 gallons of Jet fuel from barge 160-1 and delivered 55,000 gallons to tanks at Quinhagak. Upon returning to 160-1, barge OB-5 itself grounded just west of the location of the 160-1. When OB-5 refloated on a subsequent high tide, it was directed to stand by offshore as it had too much draft to conduct further work in the mouth of the Kanektok River. Crowley summoned another barge from Nome to complete the litering of the still grounded 160-1. The combination of a spring tide and a strong westerly wind produced enough water under the barge to refloat it spontaneously very early on Sept. 22. The barge was towed to the Quinhagak tank farm where it transferred all its remaining cargo with the exception of 5000 gallons of jet fuel. It subsequently was directed to Bethel where it will be inspected by the Coast Guard. Thus bringing an end to the incident. " ;

These eruptions caused lahars, extensive fllooding, and mud flows around the Drift River Tank Farm, where oil from the Cook Inlet fields is temporarily stored prior to shipping out aboard tankers. Currently, two of the four active tanks have 74,000 bbls of oil apiece. At 7:30 PM on March 23rd, ADEC and USCG conducted an over-flight to determine any potential threat to the tank farm and related facilities at the Drift River Terminal. They observed extensive flooding to the area with mud flows to a depth of six feet in the area of the runway and ballast tank, but no significant penetration of the 18 to 20 foot high teritiary containment berm around the tank farm. No oil or hazardous substance releases have been reported at this time. Cook Inlet Pipeline Company, operator of the tank farm, is planning on-the-ground evaluation today of the teritiary berms, pumps, and other equipment and facilities necessary for the operation of the tank farm. The Alaska Volcano Observatory is predicting additional explosive activity of the volcano in the near future, which combined with the extensive amount of snow and ice on the flanks of Redoubt could cause additional significant flooding and mud flows towards the Drift River Tank Farm. The Coast Guard has asked the NOAA SSC to keep fully abreast of the situation and to participate in conference calls among the CG, the state, the tank farm operator and others. The last major explosive eruption of Redoubt volcano occurred on April 4. It was the largest eruption, during this sequence, and produced the largest lahar to date, completely encircling the Drift River Tank Farm (DRTF). None of the mud or water, however, penetrated the large dikes around the facility. As an additional safety precaution, Chevron and Cook Inlet Pipeline decided to completely shut in the DRTF and proceeded to draw down the oil in the two active storage tanks to minimal levels. To achieve greater tank stability, 30,000 Bbls of fresh water was added to each of the two active tanks. With no eruptions since April 4 and dome building in the volcano's throat dramatically decreasing, the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) decided to downgrade the threat level of the volcano from orange to yellow on June 29, 2009.

An estimated 1000-2000 gallons may reach the Charles River. NSTAR/Clean Harbor have deployed assets to contain and recover the release if it reaches the Charles River. -------------------- SSC Report: SSC was contacted at 1230 EDT by Sector Boston with concerns relative to the release, even though it was some distance from the coastal zone. They wanted to both be prepared to respond and to provide assistance to the EPA OSC, if such assistance were to become necessary. NOAA/ERD chemist and senior life scientist were consulted.

Heating fuel oil was in the process of being transferred from a day tank to a second tank when it was over filled. Oil flowed into a storm drain and then into the Potomac River adjacent to Maine Street. Majority of oil was contained via booming along the floating fish markets along Maine Street in Washington Marina. GSA contracted with Miller Marine to clean up spill. Sector Baltimore, Washington DC DEQ on-scene. Boom was deployed at appropriate areas in and around Washigton Marina. Sorbents used to collect floating oil where access was available. Majority of oil trapped beneath floating docks making recovery difficult. On Friday, 12/21, Senior Chief and FOSC Mike Steele, USCG Sector Baltimore contacted NOAA SSC to request permission to use Simple Green, a surface washing agent, to clean oiled floating docks and bulkeads. I consulted direcly with DOI, NPS and FWS. FWS (Peter McGowan) informed me that there are no federally listed species in the area and since Simple Green is practically nontoxic, they have no objection to the proposed use. As DOI and NPS likewise offered no objection, I contacted the CG and provided our concurrence. Dave Anderson at NPS has been in touch with East Potomac Park staff regarding the spill. The Park reports a light sheen adjacent to the Haines Point seawall near their HQs with a very light superficial band of oil on the seawall. At this point, the Park is not interested in having the wall cleaned due to concerns about the stability of the structure. Nonethless, I advised the CG to get in touch with the NPS via Dave Anderson. FOSC Steele agreed to do so. Nonrecoverable sheen has been carried by the incoming tide past the containment booms into the tidal basin. CG estimates the size at 8 by 1200 feet hugging the Capitol side of the basin. CG has directed the contractors to double boom the opening between the basin and the channel and use absorbents between the booms. NPS will be notified. Mike Steele has inspected the area and feels that it is non recoverable sheen" ;

The source, the amount and the product were (and remain) unconfirmed. However, it is suspected that the release happened sometime on the night of Sunday January 08 and was a diesel or #2 heating oil product (chemical analysis through the USCG Marine Safety Lab is pending) and the amount is somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 gallons. Helped by slow currents and consistent west to southwest winds, a large portion of the released product pooled at the northern end of the Island End River (IER) and recovery operations have been focused there. Some oil sheen was reported in the Mystic River (upper end of Boston Harbor) and in the Chelsea River, about a half a mile east of the IER, but none of it was deemed recoverable. Protective booming of the salt marshes at the end of the Chelsea River (aka: \"Chelsea Creek\") was deployed as an extra safety measure. The Island End River is more of an inlet than a true river. Historically (a century ago) it flowed through Chelsea and Everett to the sea. Today it terminate approximately a quarter mile from the Mystic River (generally considered part of Boston Harbor), is about 200 yards wide and heavily industrialized on one side. The other side has a small park and condominium project known as Admiral Hill. Environmentally the area is of note due to historic (and heavy) contamination from coal tar. The bottom sediments as well as much of the southeastern shoreline are contaminated by chronic (now secured) and acute releases of the materials. The exposed coal tar on the shoreline dates back to the 1940s. The material is a byproduct of a large coal gasification facility that operated from the turn of the 19th century to sometime in the early 1960s. Response Activities: The USCG has been supervising the oil spill cleanup contractor as it uses vacuum trucks and sorbents to recover trapped materials. Over 3,000 gallons (oil) have been recovered thus far. NOAA Activities: The NOAA SSC has been working with the FOSC and SOSC on cleanup options and spill characterization, including work with the NOAA HAZMAT modeling staff on oil fate calculations, and reverse trajectories." ;

A 15-foot curved piece of pipe was ultimately found with the assistance of the NOAA Navigation Response Team. After further examination, the hull showed evidence that the ship may have hit more than one object. The tanker, registered in Cyprus, was carrying 325,000 barrels (13.6 million gallons) of heavy crude oil from Venezuela. The collision(s) created three holes, the largest a 6-foot by 2-foot tear in the hull that breached a center cargo tank and port side water ballast tank, releasing approximately 264,000 gallons. After the incident, a review of PORTS tide level recordings showed the collision(s) occurred at maximum spring low tide. The oil from the ruptured tank spread down river, ultimately oiling 57 miles of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware shorelines. The spill closed the Delaware River to commercial vessel traffic for over a week. Submerged oil resulted in contamination of water intakes and the closure of the Salem Nuclear Power Plant. " ;

The vessel was anchored in Tanglefoot Bay adjacent the community of Karluk on the west side of Kodiak Island. The vessel had 1000 gallons of diesel and finally came to rest at position N57-34.4, W154-29.4 where an on-scene observer reported surf crashing through the wheelhouse. Planned CG helo overflight for August 21 was canceled due to the helo mechanical problems. Instead the CG opened up the Liability Trust Fund and hired a fixed wing Beaver to fly from Kodiak and assess the situation, the report from which won't be available until the morning of August 22. NOAA has provided support with weather and resources at risk information. By Thursday night, Aug. 21, the NW winds are expected to drop to 5-15 kts, and by late Friday the wind should shift around to the SW at 10-15 kts. The grounding site is about one-half mile east of Cape Karluk, the site of a seabird rookery and about one mile west of the village of Karluk and the Karluk Lagoon which supports salmon runs May through November. The Lagoon is also the site of sea ducks, occasional sea otters, and occasional brown bear activity. PolRep 2 and final: Joint Coast Guard/ADEC team flew to Karluk on Thursday afternoon, August 21, and were able to board the F/V Donna Ann. The wheelhouse had been separated from the hull as a result of the prolonged beating by the heavy surf and the old wooden hull was in pretty bad shape. It was determined that all the diesel had been purged from the tanks and been dispersed in the large and turbulent seas. " ;

The location of the sunken vessel was N60-33.0, W145-46.3, and it went down with an estimated 500 gallons of diesel in an area of very strong tidal currents. A long oil slick was noted on the surface, and it was believed that this was just the fuel emanating from the vents and that the two fuel tanks were intact. Trying to beat some forecast heavy winds for the night of August 19, the owner immediately hired divers to plug the vents. In so doing the divers noted that the starboard tank was empty of an estimated 200 gallons of diesel. The next day, when the strong winds never materialized, divers again descended to the vessel to attempt to pump out the port fuel tank, but found it empty also. Apparently all the fuel had escaped the first day and been rapidly dispersed by the strong tidal currents, and there was probably less than 500 gallons of diesel on the vessel when in sank. NOAA provided support to the CG with weather, tidal and resources at risk information. Several sea otters and seabirds were in the vicinity, but a wildlife observer from the local Eyak native community noted no abnormal behavior." ;

The vessel operator hit a rock, after which he intentionally grounded the vessel at position, 55-53.6N, 155-13.4W. The grounding resulted in damage to the vessel's bow area, and the fuel tanks were not compromised during the incident. Nevertheless, it was taking on water. A Good Samaritan vessel delivered a pump to the F/V Chichagof, but that was unable to keep up with the flooding. Not until a Coast Guard helo from station Kodiak delivered two additional pumps was the vessel able to control the flooding. The next morning a welder and marine surveyor were on scene to assess and repair the damaged bow with a patch over the roughly 1 foot X 1 foot hole. By Saturday, August 9, the vessel was fully repaired and back fishing. NOAA supported the Coast Guard in dealing with this incidence by providing detailed weather information and forecasts, tidal data, and resources at risk information." ;

After receiving permission from the facility, the barge returned to the Conoco Philips Platform in Riverhead, NY, where they had just finished loading 110K gals of #6 oil. The sheen was first noticed at 0720 by the barge captain, Joe Barrett, when the barge was 2 miles east of the platform. The barge returned to the platform and moored at 0945. Bouchard Transportation hired Miller Environmental Group (MEG) and the National Response Corporation to address pollution concerns. MEG boomed the barge and had two boats standing by on scene. MSFO pollution investigator and MSFO marine inspector arrived on scene at approx 1000 and observed that the barge was intermittently sheening from under the water line at the bow. A Notice of Federal Interest was issued. The barge had not been involved in any grounding, allisions, or collisions since the crew had been on board. Bouchard hired divers to locate the source of the release. At 1730 the divers reported a hairline crack, approx 6-12\" long, on the bottom of number one starboard tank. The divers were able to secure the release by placing an epoxy patch on the crack. A CG-835 was issued to the barge prohibiting the transfer of oil, after discharging at Riverhead, until the barge was presented for inspection and repairs were made. The B NO. 160 was giving permission to discharge her product back to the facility. They completed transfer at 1030 on 08JUN03, and the barge made way for dry docking and repairs in Staten Island, NY. The pictures taken by inspectors from ACTNY show a 10-12\" hairline crack that was located in the #1 starboard cargo tank bottom. The fracture is apparently in way of a consistently stressed area of the barge where the forward rake slopes down to meet the forward tanks. This causes fractures in the weld supports and bottom longitudinals. It is believed that this crack is a result of an area that has been affected by heat to repair these longitudinals numerous times. NOAA supplied sensitive area information, trajectory and weather support to the FOSC. No oil was observed on any shoreline areas." ;

	osnm:hasNote "21 February 2003 - The NOAA SSC was contacted multiple times around 1100 and requested to report to the USCG Activities New York command center on Staten Island, NY. Upon arriving at the command center at noon the SSC was briefed about the barge explosion and subsequent gasoline spill. The barge (what was left of it) and manifold system on the dock were still on fire. The location of the ExxonMobile facility was: 40deg 31.5 N / 74deg 14.5 W. Trajectory and weather support were requested ASAP as well as resources at risk. Oil weathering calculations determined that the gasoline would evaporate very quickly (about 90% in the first several hours). The two major biological concerns from the environmental point of view were rafting waterfowl and potential fish kill. The SSC recommended that the fire be left burning as long as possible as long as it posed no further hazard to the facility or workers, to minimize the amount of gasoline released onto the waterway. The other safety concern expressed was the potential for gasoline to become trapped under piers and docks creating the potential for other explosive conditions. The two pipelines from the facility to the pier that were ruptured contained about 150,000 gallons each from the value to the end. One was on fire and the other leaking onto the facility. At 1530 the SSC and a MSRC representative went on an overflight of the area on a USCG helicopter. The SSC took video footage and digital photographs of the event as well as mapping the extent and quantity of oil observed in the Arthur Kill. At the time of the flight the tide was ebbing to the south. Oil was noted at the entrance to the Kills, for the most part remaining in the center of the waterway. The gasoline was mostly rainbow and gray sheens extending up to the facility. North of the site there were two other sheens noted, one probably leaching from the landfill site and another mystery sheen. The smoke plume was very visible. It wafted up about 125 feet to 300 feet and northward over Staten Island. The SSC returned to the command post and presented the video and observations to the unified command. The gasoline was for the most part non- recoverable. It was estimated that the amount observed was in the thousands of gallons, not tens of thousand or hundreds of thousands. Most of the fuel spilled was consumed in the fire or evaporated. The SSC notified Tri-State Bird Rescue of the spill and potential for oiled birds. No birds were found to be oiled. The SSC also converted video footage taken by the Vessel Traffic Service into a digital format for distribution to the media and investigating agencies. 22 February 2003 ? The SSC was supposed to participate in a first light overflight with the USCG. However, the rain and fog prohibited the aircraft from flying. At the 0800 unified command meeting a situation update was given. The manifold was still burning and would be attempted to inert and cap that morning. Joint investigations were underway by the NYC Fire Department Fire Marshals, Police Department Arson Investigations, US Coast Guard, and National Transportation Safety Board. The investigators were attempting to map the location of all of the debris. DonJon Marine was preparing a salvage plan. The Kills were still under one-way traffic with tug escorts. A sight safety plan was in place. NOAA was requested to continue weather updated for the next couple of days. The SSC participated in a news interview with the Staten Island Advance. Shoreline assessment teams reported seen sparse sheens off shore. They describe them as literally \"evaporating before our eyes.\" Heavy rains and wind were the weather of the day. The SSC was contacted by the Coney Island Aquarium concerning the possibility of gasoline entering their water intakes. They were assured that the fuel would not travel that far. The SSC converted the video footage from the previous days overflight into a digital format for distribution to the media and investigating agencies." ;

	osnm:hasNote "The NOAA SSC was notified by the Hazmat Duty Officer on Friday morning (2/14) at approximately 0630 concerning the grounding of the T/B Energy 5501 about 2 miles south of Norwalk, CT. The USCG requested the SSC on scene. The Initially, it was unknown how much home heating oil was lose from the barge. The barge was loaded with 56,000 barrels (2,352,000 gallons) and had a draft of 17.9 feet. It struck a rock charted at 18 feet mean low water. Due to the stage of the moon, falling tide, and offshore winds the water depth over the rock was minimal. The tug was hugging the CT coast to stay in the lee of winds from the NW as it headed to its destination in Port Jefferson, NY. The barge was taken to a nearby location (41deg 02.6 N / 73deg 22.053 W) and anchored. The NOAA Scientific Support Team provided the USCG initial trajectory and oil weathering information, weather, tides, and resources at risk summary. At about 0800 the CT Department of Aquaculture closed the shellfish beds in all waters in the Norwalk, Darien, and Westport area until further notice. The divers survey discovered 14 cracks and holes in all six starboard tank bottoms. The original estimate of cargo loss by the naval architect was 450 barrels (18,900 gallons). Two morning overflights (0900 and 1200) by USCG personnel spotted an oil slick extending several miles from the barge. A relief barge arrived along side the holed barge at about 1400. At 1600 the SSC, RP rep and USCG FOSC went on an overflight in a helicopter. A sheen consisting of light rainbow to silver and gray was observed several miles from the barge. It measured about 3.5 miles long by 200 yards wide at the leading edge and 600 yards wide at the trailing end. The rest of LI Sound was search and not other oil was located. The overflight also mapped locations of ice along the LI coastline. A new trajectory model was developed based on the GPS positions of the slick. With the updated oil trajectory model showing land impacts on the northern Long Island coast plans were made to pre-position protective boom as several location near identified sensitive areas. By the evening meeting at 1800 the revised estimate of lost oil was downgraded to about 53 barrels (2,226 gallons). This estimate was within the range of oil observed on the afternoon overflight. Plans were made to begin over-the-top lightering operation during the first night, but due to logistics and operational constraints they were unable to begin until later the morning of the 15th. On 2/15 the morning overflight only spotted one small streamer of light silver and gray sheen within the area predicted by the trajectory model. The stern starboard quarter of the barge was seen to be awash. No oil was observed near the barge or anywhere near the LI coast. Almost all of the oil had evaporated and naturally dispersed. The NOAA modelers were requested to provide a ?Worst Case Discharge\" trajectory for a possible release from the barge on Saturday evening or Sunday morning. The new model indicated potential land impacts on LI more westerly than the oil that was initially released. Based on the updated weather forecasts for significantly worsening weather, the Unified Command decided to move the barge into Bridgeport harbor for safe haven to make temporary repairs and off-load the cargo. At present, as of 1800 this evening (2/15) the barge is in route to Bridgeport. Travel time is anticipated to be about 5 hours at two knots. Contingency plans are prepared for the possibility of spills while enroute or in Bridgeport harbor." ;

The tug Scandia was abandoned and USCG Search and Rescue teams were dispatched to assist the crew. At approximately 2000 EST, a USCG helicopter reported that the barge North Cape was aground on Nebraska Shoals, directly adjacent to the Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge, owned and operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). The helicopter further reported that the barge was releasing oil. The barge North Cape spilled oil in two separate releases. The first, released during the height of the initial storm, was 700,000 gallons and the second, less than a day later, was 125,000 gallons. The combination of the type of oil released and the energy of the storm caused great dispersion into the water column. As a result, in the days following the spill, great numbers of shellfish (mostly bivalves and juvenile lobsters) washed ashore. Subsequently, the Rhode Island Department of Health closed more than 200 square miles of commercial fishery in the area of the spill. This closure was coordinated with the EPA Region One and with NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), which closed federal fishing grounds using the Magnuson Act. This is the first time federal fisheries have been closed due to oil contamination. The emergency phase of the response lasted seven days and the on-scene command post was demobilized following the removal of the barge North Cape from the beach. Active USCG spill response and assessment continued from the MSO, including re-survey of key impacted recreational and endangered piping plover nesting beaches.

	osnm:hasNote "On December 26, 1988, the United Marine Tug and Barge, Inc. (UMTB) Tank Barge 283, towed by the tug Marine Explorer, began sinking stern down approximately 35 miles southeast of Simeonof Island, on the western side of the Gulf of Alaska. The tug and barge, en route to Dutch Harbor with approximately 47,620 barrels of diesel on board, encountered extremely rough weather. The pump room and starboard aft tanks, which had been empty, were now flooded, causing the barge to turn bow-up with approximately 80 feet of the barge above water and the remaining 200 feet below the surface. The tug's crew members observed oil coming from the vicinity of the waste oil tanks in the stern area. Although the barge owner speculated that the stern anchor had punctured the aft waste oil tank, the exact cause of the sinking was never determined. The salvage vessel M/V Salvage Chief hired by Seattle-based UMTB arrived on January 7 after an eight-day passage from Astoria, Oregon. Meanwhile, the barge continued leaking diesel fuel as 50-60 knot winds and 20-25 foot seas pounded the area. The tug Salvage Chief arrived on-scene January 7 with divers and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to investigate the bottom of the barge. Small cracks found in the port and starboard main decks were sealed with wooden plugs.\\\\After considering all the options, UMTB asked the USCG for assistance in sinking the barge. The barge was sunk by the USCG Cutter Sedge at 1246 on January 13, 1989, approximately 11 miles southwest of the Semidi Islands at 55 48 N and 156 46 W.\\\\Due to the location of the spill, on-scene weather conditions, and the rate of oil leakage, no cleanup action was performed. By January 4, only 40 feet of the barge's bow remained above the surface. From the attitude of the barge, the owner's naval architects and salvage master speculated that four tanks remained filled with diesel fuel while the other tank's cargo was displaced by water. Initially, the owner requested resource agency clearance to move the barge to Stepovak Bay for lightering and repair operations. As the barge, with the tug and tow line still attached, drifted northeast parallel to the coast, evaluations of Stepovak, Castle, Devil's, and Kuiukta bays, along the southeastern side of the Alaska Peninsula, were requested of NOAA. The upright-floating barge was extremely difficult to tow. The vessels were caught in a clockwise back-eddy off of the southwesterly flowing Alaska stream which carried them towards the northeast. The weather remained severe (Beaufort Force 9 with icy conditions) throughout the entire incident. Even though the tug Marine Explorer remained attached to the barge, it was virtually impossible for it to influence their naturally drifting motion and trajectory. On January 11, 1989, the owners requested USCG assistance in sinking the barge. On January 13, the USCG Cutter Sedge used 1500 rounds of 20 mm fire to sink Barge 283 in approximately 102 fathoms of water. The case was closed on January 18, 1989. USCG district 17.

Weather conditions at the time of the incident were calm with a visibility of 3 miles. The vessel was holed in two cargo tanks resulting in the loss of 5690 barrels of oil into Port Angeles Harbor. Internal transfer of cargo from the holed tanks stopped the discharge of oil into the water by 2052, December 21. The ARCO Anchorage remained aground until 0244, December 22 when it was refloated and moved to deeper anchorage within Port Angeles Harbor. Through discussions with the Canadian Coast Guard it was decided that invocation of the joint U.S. Canadian response plan (CANUSPAC) was not necessary, but that close contact would be maintained. An ARCO spill response team was activated from Long Beach, California. Under the influence of wind and tides, the oil was carried to the west almost to Neah Bay and to the east to Dungeness Spit.

The vessel was loaded with 22,000 barrels of Bunker C at the time of the incident. The apparent cause was a still-air situation that developed between the mid-ship house and the afterdeck house. Vapors emitting from the cargo tank vents created a vapor cloud during ballasting. These were ignited in the midship house and flashed back through the vent piping system. The largest explosion took place in the number 10 center cargo tank. The force of the explosion propelled the main deck over the cargo tanks into the air. When the deck landed, it severed a 36-inch cargo line on top of the inshore isolation valve. This severed line fed fuel to the fire until response personnel discovered and capped it on December 21. Nine lives were lost as a result of the explosion. Debris and oil scattered in all directions. Approximately 400 boats in the vicinity were damaged by the fine mist of airborne oil, resulting in millions of dollars in property damage. An estimated 30,000 barrels of oil were released into Los Angeles harbor from the ship and the severed pipeline. A U.S. Coast Guard boat and a Los Angeles City Fire Department boat arrived on-scene within five minutes of the explosion to assist in firefighting and rescue operations. Pollution surveys were conducted after the fire was under control. Initial reports concluded that much of the oil had burned off, but on December 19, underwater divers discovered a large quantity of oil on the bottom of the harbor.

The vessel began to leak cargo from the damaged bow section. Due to the threat of explosion and fire, the Port Commandant ordered the Urquiola out of the harbor, away from the refinery and town of 200,000 inhabitants. While being assisted out of the harbor by two tugs, the leaking vessel grounded again, further rupturing the bow tanks. All of the crew, except for the captain and pilot, abandoned the ship when it began to list. Two hours later the vessel exploded, killing the captain. Approximately 513,000 barrels of oil burned in the subsequent 16-hour fire. Burning oil spread out from the vessel and was eventually extinguished by the cooling effect of the seawater. Dense clouds of smoke were blown over the town of La CoruÃ±a. A safety zone one mile in radius was established around the vessel after air monitors detected high levels of volatile gases. Despite these precautions, a second explosion and fire rocked the vessel on the morning of May 14. Between May 12 and May 21, oil was estimated to be leaking at a rate of 2,200 barrels per day. An estimated 180,000-220,000 barrels of the cargo polluted the Spanish coast. On May 21, a smaller tanker and tug began lightering the Urquiola. About 50,000 barrels of crude oil had been removed from the vessel by May 25, when lightering operations were halted by rough seas. Ten to fifteen foot seas detached a large section of the bow. On June 8, the stern section, containing an estimated 22,000 barrels of bunker fuel, was towed to a more protected area five miles to the west. The stern was partially lightered before developing a crack in one of the tanks that resulted in further, limited leakage. Following the fire, the Spanish Navy and a fleet of commercial vessels applied over 2,000 tons of chemical dispersants to the Urquiola and surrounding waters in spite of resistance mounted by Spanish oceanographers.

Oil continued to vent from natural faults several hundred yards from the platform, in tract 4042 between the coast and a chain of islands. The faults released a total of 100,000 barrels of oil until December 1969. A record-breaking storm immediately before the incident contributed to the large amount of oiled debris that needed to be collected as part of the spill response. On February 2, the National Pollution Contingency Plan, instituted by President Johnson in 1968, went into effect for the first time. The Federal Water Pollution Control Administration was on-scene to monitor the well-killing process and cleanup. Red Adair was brought in to provide expertise capping the well. To aid in predicting the slick movement, the National Weather Service set up a local station to monitor winds and tides.

USCG ACTNY responded to the notification form the vessel. MBTE is a listed hazardous material. Therefore, the response activities were conducted under CERCLA authority and funding. It was estimated that the ship had lost 350 barrels (14,700 gallons), and was leaking at about 9,000 gallons per hour. Due to the flammability of the product, the USCG set up an initial safety zone of one-half mile around the ship. Slowly that was reduced to 200 yards and then 100 yards. Eventually they were able to get Investigators aboard and do damage surveys. The crew began internal transfer of cargo out of the damaged tank. By 1830 the hole was plugged and by 0030 a temporary repair was made. It was estimated that a total of 588 barrels (25,000 gallons) was lost. USCG district 1." ;

The spill was the result of heavy rains and a \"weak\" containment dike (this is a simplified characterization of the problem). One report estimated 35,000 lbs of phosphoric acid diluted into a \"million\" gallons of water was released into a small ditch which eventually emptied into the Houston Ship Channel. A verbal assessment of the behavior of the chemical and possible risks was provided after contacting Dr. Ed Overton at LSU for his chemistry prospective and a review of the CAMEO data. 	Water monitoring had already began using a pH meter. The verbal results passed to the SSC indicated that the ditch was at pH 2 (bottom of the acid scale). However, within 40 feet of entering the ship channel, the values were neutral or background. These may have only been surface readings, so a recommendation was made that a bottom pH profile be taken. This is because concentrated solutions of phosphoric acid are more dense than water and would initially sink. Source control had reduced addition drainage from the site to a \"trickle.\" A fish kill is possible (probable). A similar release in the same location, but of a much larger volume (45,000,000 gallons), was reported to have caused a major fish kill in 1992.

The source was characterized as a 9.5/8 casing which was producing at 15,000 psi. A one mile safety zone was immediately established and the ICW closed. The NOAA SSC responded on-scene and briefed the USCG Port Captain on the information provided by the NOAA Scientific Support Team in Seattle, WA (the Home Team). As more information became available, the probable cause of the incident shifted to an explosion of a gas drying system immediately adjacent to the well head. The explosion knocked off the Christmas tree, but immediately (with 5-10 seconds) the subsurface safety system engaged shutting in the line and preventing further release of gas and oil (the system worked as designed). Wild well control specialist were brought in to install addition safety valves. At noon, the well was classified as under control, and the ICW was again opened. USCG district 8." ;

NOAA HAZMAT become involved when MSD Unalaska contacted the NOAA SSC in Anchorage for advice on whether a water or air release of this ammonia was better. The vessel is in good mechanical condition, and can sail under its own power. The systems on the vessel are generally in good working order, a fact that was confirmed when MSD Unalaska transmitted several digital photos of the refrigeration system. The question of a potential release was put to experts at NOAA HAZMAT in Seattle, as well as to A.J. St. Germain, a member of the CG Pacific Strike Force team with considerable experience dealing with these issues. After a round-table email discussion among these folks and ammonia experts with the UNOCAL urea plant in Nikiski, serious questions were raised about the possible effects and the need for any release of the ammonia, whether in water or in the air. In the end, it was determined that the risks of releasing the ammonia were greater than the risks of leaving the ammonia intact aboard the vessel while it was transitted to Seward. Crew members aboard the Arctic Wind were fully advised of the situation and the need to be on the look-out for any possible ammonia leaks in transit.

One of the barges in the tow, Hollywood 2019, was holed and released an estimated 150 bbl of \"BTEX-Raffinate.\" The spilled product is a light petroleum distillate dominated by hydrocarbons between nC-4 and nC-8 (much like gasoline). The incident occurred near beacon 42 in the Houston Ship Channel. The tow was moved to near beacon 53. MSO Houston is responding. 	At 1840 hrs (CST), the NOAA SSC was alerted of the spill by the NOAA Hazmat Duty Officer. The SSC linked up with MSO Houston and is providing technical support to include trajectory and weather information. The preliminary trajectory suggests that Dickerson Bay near April Fool's Point may be at risk, but if the volume released is only 150 bbl, the potential for land-fall is low. The spilled product will most likely be lost by a combination of evaporation and dispersion during the evening and night. USCG district 8.""" ;

	osnm:hasNote "On 25 February Coast Guard MSO New Orleans received a report that four gasoline tank barges pushed by the M/V Melinda Brent allided with the Simmesport R/R bridge located at mile marker 4.9 on the Atchafalaya River. The four barges had broken loose from the towboat and three were fully involved in fire. An unknown amount of gasoline was leaking into the river. Barges are lashed together and are located at mile 14.5. Total product onboard the four barges was 70,000 bbl (2,940,000 gallons) of gasoline. NOAA was asked to provided scientific support relative to possible fate scenarios and resources at risk. The river was at normal-to-low water levels, and well within its banks. Therefore, the resources of greatest risk are those in the river itself. Gasoline is expected to completely evaporate, so the risk to aquatic resources is from acute toxicity from exposure to the highly soluble toxic fractions and near the source. Transport down river was not expected to be uniform. Gasoline could collect in eddies and oxbows, and present a potential for downstream localized hazards. In these collection areas, the gasoline could also absorb to available organic material. In addition, a local toxic shock to biota in shallow nearby areas was possible. Pallid sturgeon (a listed endangered species) were present in the river, but were predicted to be concentrate at the control structure (upstream of the release site and not at significant risk). Other rare species thought present in the river at the time of the incident were paddlefish and blue suckers. These fish are highly mobile able to avoid exposures that would result in death. Exceptions might be to juvenile fish in shallow areas close to the shoreline. The greatest risk was to the commercial fishery. An estimated 25-30 commercial fishermen worked the stretch threatened. Commercial fisheries at risk included buffalo, freshwater drum, and several species of catfish. Other resources present in the area included eagles and wading bird colonies. For two days the barges were allowed to burn. When the fire significant subsided, fire suppression experts attached the fire with water and foam. The barges were then allowed to cool and possible reignition minimized by a foam blanket. All barges were lightered and moved off scene by the evening of 28 February. Only a \"negligible amount\" of gasoline was thought lost downstream. USCG district 8." ;

The spill resulted when an anchor from a semi-submersible drilling rig dragged across and damaged a 24\" pipeline at both the impact site and at a platform more than a mile away. Oil was released from both locations. The water depth was greater than 400 feet. The initial release volume, based on the amount of oil transferred between the time of the incident and shut in was 1839 bbl. The line was owned by Equilon Pipeline and identified as part of the Poseidon Pipeline System. The NOAA SSC relocated to the Shell Command Post at the request of the USCG to support the on-scene incident commander. Preliminary trajectories suggested that the oil would move west and north. Landfall was not predicted for several days. The type of oil was a medium sour crude with an API gravity of 31.5. Such oils may form persistent tarballs and be transported long distances. Skimmers were activated. Given the potential for environmental injury from the spill, dispersants were evaluated and approved under the RRT6 preapproval guidelines by the COTP Morgan City. The sea state (10-15 knot winds and 4-5 foot seas) was ideal for oil dispersion. Between 1530 CST and dusk, a total of 3000 gallons were applied (1000 gallons by DC-3 and 2000 gallons by DC-4). The SMART team from USCG Gulf Strike Team was launched and provided visual monitoring. Observers clearly observed a dispersant plume and not just surface herding. It was estimated that 75% of the surface oil had been dispersed. Dispersant operations ended due to darkness. During the evening and night, overflights were conducted with both IR and SLAR to maintain contact with the oil. USCG district 8." ;

The vessel sank in 30 feet of water, 6-8 miles west of the pass entrance. The vessel was reported to have approximately 7000 gallons of diesel fuel oil and 30 gallons of lube oil onboard. The amount released was unknown. Subsequent USCG overflights observed no visible sheens associated with the fishing vessel. Since no sheens were observed, there was reason to suspect that a majority of the diesel fuel was still on-board. The USCG considered the sunken vessel a hazard to both navigation and the environment. While diesel is generally considered a nonpersistant oil with a relatively high evaporation rate and natural dispersion rate, most diesel fuel oils are, at the same time, highly toxic. The NOAA SSC was asked to provide information to assess potential spill trajectories and possible environmental affects related to the sunken fishing boat. NOAA also provided an evaluation of potential damages under possible spill scenarios using the Type A Model. This information was used to develop both a response strategy and a cost-benefit analysis related to salvage operations and cost. Using the information provided by NOAA, the MSO was able to develop and negotiate a cost effective salvage plan. The diesel fuel was pumped off the vessel eliminating the environmental hazard. The evaluation process developed during the F/V LORENTINE III response became a template for future similar responses off the Texas/Louisiana coast. USCG district 8." ;

The freighter Blue Master suffered two gashes 1 and 2 meters above the waterline and along a tank containing IFO 180 (a bunker-type fuel oil). Oil was in the water. Initial estimates of the volume released ranged between 50 and 315 barrels (110 barrels was the final estimate). Given the persistence of heavy fuel oil, the threat to coastal resources, and the potential for shoreline oiling, dispersants were considered. After an afternoon overflight, more oil was discovered. Based on this and previous observations it was decided to use dispersants. At approximately 1830, a DC-4 arrived and sprayed dispersant on the 3-nm by 5-m oil slick. A total of 700 gallons of Corexit 9500 was applied to the slick. An overflight August 30 showed a 4-mile long sheen, still 30 miles offshore. Observation conditions were good light and absolutely calm seas. No black oil was visible, only sheen.

No release of cargo or fuel bunkers was seen during the initial USCG overflight. The vessel grounded on the Canadian side of the river, and for the most part, Canadian interests conducted the response efforts. However, the grounding posed a high risk of contamination that would involve United States' efforts if a spill were to happen. By day two, the vessel's Oil Spill Response Organization (OSRO) had boomed off the ship and lightering operations were underway. OSRO are many cleanup agencies or companies that can be contracted by a vessel that has a U.S. port on its itinerary. The names of OSRO's are supplied to the vessel by the USCG to be used voluntarily to secure an agency to perform cleanup operations during the ship's transit in US waters. The Canadians have a similar program but they are called simply ROs (Response Organizations). The National Strike Team (NST) Coordination Center reviews each company that wishes to be included on the OSRO list. They must meet certain criteria to be allowed as a response organization. Once approved any vessel determines which OSRO will be suitable for their area of transit and what they are carrying. Or they may contract an organization elsewhere to suit their's and the USCG's needs. On day three the vessel was successfully pulled off and anchored for a hull inspection by divers. There was no major damage to the vessel's integrity so she was allowed to steam to a dry dock facility for repairs. The USCG monitored the situation. The ship is carrying a cargo of powdered cement and has 98.2 metric tons(105,000 gallons) of IFO 180 fuel oil and 98.2 metric tons(27,000 gallons) of diesel. No product has been spilled.

	osnm:hasNote "This spill occurred sometime after midnight on February 10, 1999, when a 10-inch pipeline burst open on top of a hill overlooking Fort Loudoun Lake on the Tennessee River. Phone calls soon began to filter into the local fire station describing a strong diesel smell within a cluster of homes at Scottish Pike in South Knoxville, Tennessee. When a fire truck arrived on-scene, a fountain of diesel fuel was spewing heavily onto an adjacent house and an immediate evacuation of six homes took place. At the same time notification to shut down its pipeline was given to Colonial Pipeline (RP). They were also told to boom off Goose Creek, at the junction of the creek and the Lake. The diesel had flowed down an embankment to Goose Creek then into the lake and river creating a slick 60 feet wide and several miles long. The USCG was notified and dispatched a team from MSD Nashville and three members of the USCG GST. EPA arrived on-scene the morning of February 13 and assumed the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) position since the spill originated from shore. The cause of the spill will be investigated by the National Transit Safety Board (NTSB). The spill occurred at river mile (RM) 647.5, which is below the City of Knoxville's water intakes. Additionally the river is controlled by a dam ( Fort Loudoun Lake Dam) that shut down operations soon after notification of the spill. By midmorning the RP and contracted response organizations had boomed off three locations down river. Because it was dyed red the diesel produced a very noticeable slick. The current in the area was flowing at 1 knot and a little faster in the river bend just a couple of miles downstream from Goose Creek in the area called Sequoyah Hills. From there the river opens up wider and the current drops off significantly. As the diesel spread out, rainbow sheens developed. This was prevalent between Sequoyah Hills and a mile down river to Looney Island. As the spilled diesel weathered, silver sheens became more prevalent after day two and even more on day three. Additionally silver steaks could be seen from the air leeching off a point at RM 645. South of Looney Island to Sequoyah Park the diesel was observed to be in streaks and patches. On shore the diesel penetrated deep into the riprap shorelines and maybe an inch into the fine-grain sand shores from Goose Creek to Sequoyah Hills. Oil film and a brown frothy mousse could be seen downstream of Sequoyah Hills. Additional shoreline impacts were at the booming site at Sequoyah Park where unweathered diesel pooled at the junction of the boom and shoreline. Some oiled debris was located at RM 639 near Maxey's Boat Dock. Fortunately half the area is guarded by bedrock bluffs resulting in less shoreline impact and probably accounted for a high percentage of recovery noted by the RP. Officially, 45,000 gallons of diesel was released and 90% was recovered by skimmers and vacuum trucks. The initial report of the spill indicated that there had been 80,000 gallons of diesel released. In which case the mass balance breaks down to 50% recovered, 30% evaporated, 15% Goose Creek soils, and 5% other shoreline impacts. USCG district 8.

In general, given the type of oil, quantity spilled, and current offshore weather and ocean currents, the potential for observable beach oiling is very low. Nearly half of the oil will evaporate and the rest will form small tarballs. The later are very persistent and may travel many hundreds of miles, but will probably be so highly spatially dispersed that they will be virtually undetected. They will be lost among the background tarball population of the Gulf of Mexico. Tarballs in the Gulf of Mexico are derived from both natural seeps and anthropogenic spills.

The mixture is normally recirculated and reclaimed but, because of a misaligned valve, the mixture was released into a bermed sump area on the dock. The oil mixture overflowed the berm and entered Puget Sound. Boom was deployed around the spill site and geographical response plan protection strategies were implemented ahead of the expected path of the oil. The highest priority for protection was determined to be Lummi Bay with its large areas of protected mud flats and eelgrass beds. Overflights conducted on August 6 also reported the presence of killer whales and harbor seals feeding on migrating salmon near the oil slick. These areas were closely monitored by Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife overflights with no impacts to whales or seals observed.

Of primary concern were the sheltered salt marshes of the Great Salt Pond on the northwest side of the island and the lobster population in the immediate area. The winds were from the southwest, blowing oil out to sea and away from sensitive areas. Over the next 48 hours, small craft advisories and gale warnings with 6- to 12-foot seas were forecast from the southwest, endangering the vessel's position. Attempts to bring an offloading vessel alongside were hampered by the heavy weather and shallow water. On December 23, 1996, overflight observers saw rainbow sheens from the vessel extending northeasterly for approximately one mile. It was believed that the starboard tank was holed and leaking. The heaviest weather passed through on December 24, 1996. The following day the vessel was intact, but it was believed that more fuel had been released and the starboard tank was holed. The FOSC suspended operations over the holiday. On December 26 a USCG dedicated pollution overflight observed very little sheening. The USCG and salvors began offloading operations. By December 27 it was estimated that more than 3,100 gallons of fuel had been removed and approximately 4,000 gallons had been lost.

Some of the material was recovered but, once in the water, it congealed into white, jelly-like globs, some as large as golf balls.

Accounting for a rising tide and southwesterly winds, the pilot approached the opening from the northern portion of the Fore River and misspoke the helm command. By the time the order could be corrected, less than a minute later, the vessel was committed and allision (a moving object hitting a stationary one) imminent. The Julie N struck the southern side of the bridge, a sharp buttress damaged her just below the waterline The exposed part of the bridge opened a 15-foot hole into the forward port bunker tank, the forward void space, and the number one port cargo tank. The gash in the cargo tank was small by comparison to that of the bunker tank, less than a foot wide and approximately three feet high. The bunker tanks were carrying intermediate fuel oil (IFO) 380. The vessel reported the allision immediately to the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and asked permission to proceed to the Sprague Terminal, some 1,000 yards downriver. Permission was granted. The Julie N headed for the terminal, leaking oil as she went. The local oil spill cooperative, Clean Casco Bay, Inc., was notified as were state and federal authorities.

The responsible party was very cooperative with the USCG and was very proactive in attempts to salvage the barge. The continuation of high winds, however, caused further deterioration and damage to the barge, so it was towed offshore and scuttled. The owner saved a large crane onboard and used temporary patches to ensure the barge's flotation en route to the scuttle area. Heavy weather persisted as the barge was towed offshore.

The vessel was approximately 10 miles west of Cape Sarichef on the western side of Unimak Island and riding in relatively calm seas. At the time of the fire, the vessel was carrying 126,000 gallons of diesel fuel, 7 bottles of acetylene, 12 bottles of oxygen, 10,000 gallons of lube oil, 8 drums of hydraulic oil, 2 drums of gasoline, and 38,000 pounds of ammonia. After the initial diesel release on July 24, additional oil pollution was considered a low probability as the integrity of the fuel tanks and hull were not threatened by the fire. The USCG responded to what was initially a search and rescue mission. They safely rescued all but one crewmember who, unfortunately, was killed while fighting the fire. The fire caused the failure of a 10,000-gallon diesel day tank on the fore deck and the explosion, release, and fire of most of the 38,000 pounds of ammonia. The diesel release resulted in a reported 8-mile long sheen that dissipated within 12 hours. To move the vessel from the sensitive resources in Unimak Pass, a bridle was fitted to the stern of the All Alaskan and she was slowly towed westward to deeper water in case scuttling became necessary. The fire subsided by Monday, July 25 but continued smoldering in the fore peak holds of the vessel. Three USCG cutters and several members of the Pacific Strike Team went to the scene to assist. On July 26 the vessel was brought into Captain's Bay at Dutch Harbor where the fire was completely extinguished and the vessel was thoroughly evaluated.

The 202-foot Cynthia M, with a capacity of 340,000 gallons, was loaded with 310,000 gallons of a 30 percent solution of caustic soda. Her list was suspected to have been caused by open valves that allowed free communication of liquids between internal tanks. The weather onscene was winds from the southwest at 15 to 20 knots. The tidal excursions for the Hackensack River were estimated to be between three-quarters of a mile and one mile. The port side of the barge was completely submerged from center line to rail, resting solidly on the bottom. The USCG, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy, and New Jersey Marine Police went to the scene and assessed the situation. Initially, the capsizing of the vessel and its subsequent loss of cargo were the greatest concerns. On March 16 it was estimated that approximately 150,000 gallons of cargo had been lost into the Hackensack River and Newark Bay.

	osnm:hasNote "On February 9, 1994, there was a pipeline leak at the Mistryski Power Plant along the Detroit River in Detroit, Michigan. The power plant is approximately two miles downriver of the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit. The leak was continuous and occurred from approximately 2230 on February 9 to 0330 on February 10 and was described as flowing at the rate of a fire-hose discharge. Oil had broken through a corroded portion of a 10-inch supply line, ran into a storm sewer, and then traveled about 100 feet to enter the river. When the incident occurred, the Detroit River was 95 percent ice-covered. Originally the released product was thought to be a #6 oil, but laboratory analysis proved it was a #4 fuel with density of 0.93. The original estimate of 10,000 to 30,000 gallons proved a conundrum as only about 300 gallons was observed in the river. Later volume refinements had the number at officially less than 900 gallons and most likely around 300 gallons. The City of Detroit assumed responsibility for the spill and immediately hired Marine Pollution Control. Only a limited response was possible due to the ice. A portion of the spilled oiled was recovered by removing the oil-stained ice accessible from the shorelines. The Detroit City Laboratory performed the first analysis on the oil, determining that it was a #4 rather than a #6, and that it was a \"floater\". The City immediately hired Tri-State Bird Rescue to assess the threat to nearly 5000 birds in the oiled area and to establish a rehabilitation center, if necessary. The Joint U.S./Canada contingency plan was invoked and a unified command was formed among the USCG, the City of Detroit, the State of Michigan, and the Canadian Coast Guard. All activities took place at the MSO Detroit office. The active response lasted for only four days. On the fifth and sixth days, the temperature rose into the 40s and the wind shifted to from the east allowing more of the oil-stained ice to migrate to the shoreline where it could be removed. The increased temperatures caused an ice jam that flushed all the remaining oiled ice down the Trenton Channel into still frozen Lake Erie. Only two oiled birds died as a result of the spill.

With NOAA assisting, they evaluated resources, made contingency plans, and issued the following conditions under which the vessel could leave the Bay: 1) The vessel will get underway shortly before high tide and transit the bay at ebb tide at no more than five knots down the main channel 2) An LCM with pollution response equipment will escort the ship 3) Speed outside Glacier Bay will be determined by the vessel's master 4) The vessel will make periodic security broadcasts while inside Glacier Bay The vessel safely exited the Bay on August 24. Media interest was very high throughout the event because the incident occurred in a National Park. USCG district 17. Keyword: evaporation, salvage, air activated pumps." ;

The NOAA SSC was contacted as approximately 1300. It was determined that the threat to aquatic life in the Penopscot River had, for the most part, subsided, given that the spill had occurred some 12 hours earlier on a falling tide. It was thought that the chemical would have an acute toxic effect and would dilute as it moved down the river becoming a diluted, non-toxic solution. Concern was expressed that the chemical might stay together as a plume for a distance down river, but that within 12-24 hours the bulk of the product would be diluted sufficiently.

Coast Guard (USCG) Marine Safety Office (MSO) Honolulu received a report from the USCG Cutter Sassafras of a strong odor of diesel near their berth on Sand Island in Honolulu Harbor. USCG pollution investigators identified the tank vessel Yupex, as the source of the spill. The Yupex is a small Panamanian-flagged tanker owned by a Korean company that provides fuel to fishing fleets. While taking on fuel at the Pacific Resources Incorporated (PRI) terminal at pier 29, a valve was left partially open allowing diesel being loaded into the tanker's #1 ballast tanks to leak out into the harbor. The diesel continued to leak as the vessel transited to pier 35 where it docked to take on more cargo. An independent marine surveyor gauged the tanks on board the Yupex and found 21,500 gallons less than what the vessel reported to have on board when it left pier 29. The Yupex had also filed a protest with the PRI terminal indicating that they received 5,000 gallons less diesel than the terminal claims they pumped. On the basis of this information, the USCG estimated that the volume of diesel spilled was about 25,000 gallons. Cleanup was initiated at 0700 on November 20 by the USCG contractor Pacific Environmental Corporation (PENCO). The vessel's owners accepted responsibility for the cleanup later the same day.

The spill was possibly from bilge pumping. The identity of the spiller is unknown at this time. The spilled waste oil is suspected to have been treated with bilge cleaner by the spiller. The spilled oil initially impacted approximately 2 miles of the south bank of the Neches River. The impact was in pockets along the shoreline and had moderately impacted some marshy areas associated with the small pockets of oil. The salinity of the river water in the vicinity of the spill is estimated at 0.1 ppt (estimate made by MSO Port Arthur). The current in the area of the spill is estimated at no more than 0.5 kts. On October 16, MSO Port Arthur FOSC representative, LCDR Ross Tuxhorn was contacted by the NOAA SSC at the request of the CG District 8 Marine Safety Office representative, CDR Wieczynski. At that time the FOSCR stated the problem as noted above and further requested information related to a request by the Texas General Land Office to do an experiment on a designated area of the spill with Oil Spill Eater II (an enzyme product that is advertised as a biological dispersant. This is one of ten products that have been chosen for testing by NETAC. After consulting with the NOAA Hazmat Biological Assessment Team (Rebecca Hoff), LSU (Charlie Henry), and RPI (Jeff Dahlin), the SSC relayed the information to the FOSC verbally. The result of the conversation was that the recommendation was that this was not a proper type of oil, or a proper area to experiment with OSE II, and that it was recommended that the experiment not be carried out on this particular spill. The details of the consultations were put in written form by LSU and RPI and these documents were FAXed to the FOSC and the RRT-6 members on October 16. On October 17, the FOSCR accomplished a recon of the affected area and decided to change the locations of the areas to be used for an experiment to two drainage outlets that had been affected. these outlets are owned by Dupont. There is an estimated 15-25 gallons of the waste oil remaining in these two outlets that would be treated with the OSE II. The above change in locations was mentioned at the conference call that took place on October 17 at 1230 CT. During the call RRT members voiced concerns over the lack of an appropriate monitoring plan, the chemistry of the waste oil, the need to acquire the approval of the land owner to test on Dupont land, and the lack of a plan to handle the treated product in the event of flooding that would require Dupont to empty the waste oil and product into the Neches River.

Ten to fifteen minutes after the collision, the Tenyo Maru sank in an estimated 350 feet of water. The Tenyo Maru, carrying 6,500 barrels of intermediate fuel oil, 2,166 barrels of diesel oil, and some quantity of lube, bilge and fish oils, began leaking oil shortly after it sank. There were conflicting reports of the weather at the time of the collision, several reports claiming that the weather was clear, while others maintained that it was foggy. The incident occurred in Canadian waters very near the Canadian/United States boundary. The Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) and the United States Coast Guard (USCG) implemented the Canadian/U. S. Joint Marine Pollution Contingency Plan. Since the spill occurred in Canadian waters, the CCG took the lead role in coordinating the spill response. Ultimately, the majority of shoreline oiling occurred in the United States. The USCG federalized the U.S. cleanup effort, accessing funding through the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, on July 30 when the owner of the Tenyo Maru discontinued funding the cleanup. The Tenyo Maru continued to leak oil after it sank, with the largest amount released shortly after the sinking. Response to the incident continued into late August. The bulk of the response effort was scaled down by August 29, as the amount of oil being released from the sunken vessel on a daily basis had reduced significantly.

In a meeting with the USCG On-Scene Coordinator (OSC), Apex was criticized for allowing the cleanup contractors to operate without direct supervision. At the suggestion of the OSC, Apex hired O'Brien Oil Pollution Services to oversee the cleanup operations as well as Garner Environmental Services and Industrial Cleanup, Inc. for addition cleanup support. On July 30, the cargo of theApex 3503 was lightered to the Apex 3510 which was then taken to Houston for offloading. On July 31, the HSC was opened to inbound single-width barge tows only, under positive control of the Vessel Traffic Service, and with assistance from at least one tug when proceeding past the accident site. These traffic restrictions remained in effect until August 3. Following the movement of Apex 3417 from the middle of the channel on August 3, the HSC was restricted to one-way traffic only, with direction of travel being reversed every 8 to 12 hours. After cleaning, gas freeing, and welding repairs, Apex 3417 was towed to Galveston. The HSC was opened to all ship traffic without restriction on August 10. Cleanup operations continued until the case was closed on August 17, 1990. USCG district 8.

The spill posed a potential threat to local drinking water intakes as well as sensitive habitats in back channels, shoals, embayment areas, and tributaries. The Regional Response Team was activated from April 1-4. The USCG Atlantic Strike Team (AST) monitored cleanup and provided site safety. The AST and MSO personnel formed two shoreline cleanup monitoring teams on April 2. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA) promulgated information on potential alternative water supplies. The Ohio River Sanitation and Navigation Commission (ORSANCO) collected water samples and used fluorometry to analyze concentrations of the pollutant in the river.

Exxon personnel notified the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) as well as other involved agencies, and activated the Clean Harbors Cooperative (Coop). Exxon company volunteers had periodically received practical training on how to deploy boom and other Coop equipment. This previous training expedited the decision-making process and allowed Exxon to begin response efforts immediately. Initial response efforts focused on containment of the spill as well as removal of the heaviest concentration of oil. Environmentally sensitive areas were protected with boom and skimmers that collected the heavier concentrations of free-floating oil. Since the incident occurred in January, few migratory birds were in the spill area. Even so, Tri-State Bird Rescue treated over 100 oiled birds that were recovered during the incident. Cleanup crews in the spill area found over 600 dead birds. A cleanup committee, consisting of representatives from USCG, Exxon, NOAA, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NY DEC), New Jersey State Department of Environmental Protection (NJ DEP), and New York City Parks and Recreation, monitored cleanup progress until the end of active recovery. On February 14, substantial deposits of fresh oil were found in sediments above peat areas on Pralls Island. Trenches were dug to collect oil for vacuuming. By March 15, all areas were considered \"clean\" by the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) except Pralls Island where further cleanup activity was postponed due to the arrival of wading birds that breed on the island.

Oil leaked from a severed discharge line near the bottom of one or both of these 54,000-barrel capacity tanks. It then overflowed the containment dike and moved toward the beach 250 feet away. VIWAPA personnel constructed sand-based containment trenches and berms along the beach to contain the oil. They also diverted oil to a diesel storage tank containment area. Oil began to leak through the trenches, proceeding down the sloping base toward the shoreline. U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Marine Safety Office (MSO) San Juan personnel flew over the area on September 21 and estimated that approximately 48 barrels of oil had overflowed the trench and entered the harbor, impacting the sand beaches west of the facility. MSO and USCG Atlantic Area Strike Team (AST) personnel arrived on-scene on September 22. They immediately began working with VIWAPA and contractor personnel to locate and stop the leak. The Strike Team lowered the level of oil in the containment areas and secured the leak on September 25. The containment wall had been blown by the wind onto a ten-inch transfer pipe, rupturing the pipe. An open valve had permitted the oil to escape through the broken pipe. A total of 14,076 barrels escaped from this tank between September 18 and 25. Approximately 1,000 barrels overflowed the containment area and entered the water. Three miles of sand beaches were heavily oiled, with some impacts east of the power plant in the harbor area. Some of the oil refloated, but local meteorological and oceanographic conditions isolated the resultant secondary impacts to previously oiled beaches.

NOAA reported that the shoreline is mostly sand beaches, gravel beaches, mixed sand and gravel beaches, and rocky shores or seawalls. The offshore islands that are surrounded by mangroves would not be affected if the winds continued to be easterly. NOAA estimated that the slick would tend to the west or northwest and would come ashore on beaches inshore and to the west of the facility. This could have occurred for a considerable distance, depending on the weather conditions and local small-scale oceanographic circulation patterns. There was a small chance that, with a large enough quantity of free-floating, unrestricted oil and continued easterly winds, the oil might round Punta Guayanilla and impact the beaches of Punta Verraco and Bahia de Guayanilla. If this did happen, NOAA advised that the large mangrove forests of Bahia de Guayanilla be protected. NOAA further advised that the oil would persist in the environment, with a small quantity evaporating during weathering. Reef impacts would be low because the oil is not very soluble" ;

Some boom had been deployed around portions of the barges and numerous vessels of lengths up to 35 feet, in various stages of maintenance or disrepair surrounded the barge hulls. Because the barges were unattended and threatened by local high water runoff and local vessel traffic, the SSC recommended immediate efforts to double boom and isolate the barges. Security measures were suggested to prevent tampering and further damage to the barges until the material within could be properly identified, safely removed and isolated for disposal. \"Core\" samples from each tank and Level B personnel protection were also strongly recommended. In addition, the SSC recommended that local and state water board, storm levy and canal lock officials be contacted to ensure immediate emergency response should waters from the spill site and Doullut Canal have to be isolated from the Mississippi River and the sensitive areas of Adams Bay and surrounding wetlands.

The accident occurred during daylight hours with partly cloudy skies, calm seas, winds NW at 5-10 knots, and visibility 6-8 miles. The response began immediately. Seven rescue ships and several USCG vessels with boom arrived at the scene of the grounding within eleven minutes. The USCG Atlantic Strike Team (AST) was activated within thirty minutes. The pre-designated Federal On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) was the Captain of the Port (COTP), Providence, Rhode Island. The OSC assumed federal responsibility for the spill response within two hours, following the determination that the incident was beyond the control of the ship's captain and the owners, Ballard Shipping of Monrovia, Liberia. A $50,000 ceiling on the pollution fund was established, which was later raised to $3.4 million. The OSC immediately hired cleanup contractors and requested boom and other cleanup equipment.

The vessel was traveling outside normal shipping lanes in an attempt to avoid ice. Within six hours of the grounding, the Exxon Valdez spilled approximately 10.9 million gallons of its 53 million gallon cargo of Prudhoe Bay Crude. Eight of the eleven tanks on board were damaged. The oil would eventually impact over 1,100 miles of non-continuous coastline in Alaska, making the Exxon Valdez the largest oil spill to date in U.S. waters. The response to the Exxon Valdez involved more personnel and equipment over a longer period of time than did any other spill in U.S. history. Logistical problems in providing fuel, meals, berthing, response equipment, waste management and other resources were one of the largest challenges to response management. At the height of the response, more than 11,000 personnel, 1,400 vessels and 85 aircraft were involved in the cleanup. Shoreline cleanup began in April of 1989 and continued until September of 1989 for the first year of the response. The response effort continued in 1990 and 1991 with cleanup in the summer months, and limited shoreline monitoring in the winter months.

The fire was initially contained by the Springfield Fire Department, using only dry chemicals because the chemicals stored at the facility would react with water to produce considerable heat, releasing chlorine and other toxic fumes. At about midnight on the same day, a second fire broke out when the materials on site reacted with rainwater entering through damaged windows. The fire also set off the sprinkler system which added more water, escalating the chemical reaction. The old brick, stone, and wood timber mill facility that contained Advanced Laboratories was destroyed. The fire and chemical reactions also produced a moving and often invisible plume of wood smoke, choking chlorine, and other toxic gases that enveloped the fire scene and the surrounding area. Late on June 18, the fire increased in intensity with chemical containers occasionally exploding or otherwise reacting with water and/or the surrounding fire to produce large quantities of additional heat, chlorine, and other combustion gases. At approximately 1800 on June 18, the Springfield Fire Department elected to deluge the fire scene with huge quantities of water. The plume of chlorine and other combustion and reaction gases extended downwind for several miles in a north by northeast direction. USCG district 1." ;

Observations included a continuous discharge from the clarifier outfall and residual oil along shoreline as far as one-half mile downriver. A second visit by boat was made on April 13. The discharge was continuous throughout this visit as well. Nonimpacted shoreline above the discharge and bottom samples from the nearshore area further delineated the extent of contamination. Calculations of the impact suggest a volume of between 100 and 1,000 gallons of residual petroleum along the shoreline. This volume of petroleum would likely dissipate in a matter of weeks once the release was discontinued. The surrounding area along the Detroit River was also considered in making the recommendation.

The New Bedford Fire Department had approximately 200 pounds of a dry chemical fire extinguisher, Metal X, on hand. NOAA/OAD's backup recommendation ( if the dry chemical fire extinguisher did not work) was to flood the hopper bin with very large quantities of water. The New Bedford Fire Department used the Metal X fire extinguisher and large quantities of Fuller's Earth. NOAA now advised that large quantities of water would be an unsuitable backup plan under these conditions, because any quantity of water might no be able to get through the dry chemical and Fuller's earth barrier to adequately cool the burning zinc.

The Coast Guard COTP and New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) advised the facility on appropriate methods to reduce effects to the environment and ensure compliance with environmental laws. A brown, milky plume was observed along the shore of the Kill and out approximately 100 feet before it dissipated. Testing of pH with litmus paper revealed the pollutant to be of a pH greater than 14 along the shore, where it entered the water. USCG district 3." ;

The barge was loaded with 20,000 barrels of Number 6 Fuel Oil. Fifteen minutes later, the E-24 was standing almost vertically with about 20 feet of the barge visible above the surface of the water. At the time of the incident, there was heavy rain, 5-6 foot seas, and winds from the east at 25 knots. The incident took place in an area known as \"The Race\", the passage between the Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean, which typically has severe rip tides and rough, unpredictable seas. On November 23 at 2250 the barge sank in a keel-up position in 185 feet of water. Approximately 15-24 barrels of Number 6 fuel oil was forced from compartment vents, and as much as 47 barrels of diesel fuel was lost from the pump room. The cargo compartments were not damaged during the sinking. Oil from the barge formed a slick measuring 0.5 miles long by 500 yards wide as observed on November 23. Cleanup of the Long Island shoreline began on November 24 and was completed by December 5. Approximately 1000 gallons of oily debris were recovered. Later releases of oil occurred during the salvage operations, but skimming equipment was on station and recovered most of that lost oil immediately. An estimated 225 birds were affected by the spill, with 75 of these recovered dead. Salvage of the barge without damaging the intact cargo compartments was the major concern. Due to heavy seas and limitations of equipment on scene, the exact position of the barge could not be determined and verified until December 19. On January 3, 1986, the USCG On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) federalized the case as the responsible party, Eklof Transportation Co., Inc. was unable to meet the deadlines imposed by the OSC for performing the hull survey and inspection. Evaluation, planning, and mobilization for the salvage operations took place from January 3 to May 4, 1986. The salvage plan was developed by the United States Navy Supervisor of Salvage (NAVSUPSALV) at the request of the OSC. The OSC staff report was completed on March 3, and detailed three salvage options determined by the NAVSUPSALV. After much deliberation, the OSC determined that the barge should be raised with its cargo intact. Salvage operations took place from May 5 to May 30, 1986. Approximately 235 gallons of oil were lost during the entire operation, of which 185 were recovered. The barge was inspected and in tow by the evening of May 29, and was moored at Mariners Harbor, Staten Island, New York by 1900, May 30. The E-24 was completely offloaded by June 11, 1986, and the case was closed. USCG district 1.

The vessel suffered a structural failure which ruptured the hull near the No. 2 tanks. The resulting spill of approximately 65,500 barrels of Venezuelan Merey and Pilon crude oil was carried in a westerly direction by wind and currents. Offshore recovery was hampered by rough weather and the magnitude of the spill. The water temperature was 80?F and winds were from the east and northeast 15-20 knots. The spill moved slowly westward, coming ashore near High Island, along the Bolivar Peninsula, and into Galveston Bay, Texas between Aug. 2-5. Oil impacts were severe at Rollover Inlet and Crystal Beach, and on Aug. 4 more oil was pushed ashore further south along the Galveston Island coast. The spill affected 90% of Galveston's West Beach, including 80% of the Galveston seawall and the associated rock groins and pilings. Oil in the seawall area was a concern due to the oils smothering effect on marine organisms. Organisms in this area were determined to be a minor part of the entire ecosystem and due to their transient nature were able to move to more suitable habitats. Several dead crabs, rays, and fish were recovered along the seawall but could not be directly attributed to the spill. Also oiled were marsh grass areas in East Bay (10-20 barrels) and 2 small lagoons. Some oil which entered Galveston Channel did affect several small sand islands used as nesting sites for birds, although no affected birds or eggs were reported. One oiled sea turtle was cleaned and released. Tourism losses were estimated at $1 million per day. Commercial shrimp fishermen filed a suit for $10 million.

The master and seven crew members died as a result of the accident. Approximately 98,955 barrels of oil spilled into the sea as a result of the breakup. The bow section, which still contained 36,650 barrels of oil, sank in 300 feet of water. Substantial amounts of oil continued to leak from the sunken bow until several small leaks in the bow were sealed in May. The stern remained afloat and was towed to the port of Le Havre where its remaining 54,975 barrels of oil were offloaded. Strong northwest winds at the time of the incident moved the oil towards the Breton coast. Due to the high viscosity of the oil and severe weather conditions, containment or dispersal at sea was impossible. Because the spring tides in this region have an average tidal range of 26 feet, many areas along the coast could not be boomed effectively. Consequently, the Breton coast (which had already received major oil impacts from the Torrey Canyon spill in 1967 and the Amoco Cadiz in 1978), was again severely oiled. Approximately 45 percent of the Amoco Cadiz spill area was affected by oil from the Tanio. Approximately 125 miles of the coastline of the two Departments of Finistere and Cotes-du-Nord were oiled. Both Departments implemented the Plan Polmar, the French national oil spill contingency plan, due to the severity of the coastal oiling. This enabled them to use the national army for cleanup operations. Personnel from the Civil Defense organization, fire service, local governments, commercial contractors, and local farmers were also involved in the cleanup. The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF) provided technical advice and monitored cleanup activities on behalf of the International Oil Pollution Compensation (IOPC) Fund. Cleanup operations in the two Departments varied due to differences in the severity of the pollution, nature of the shoreline, and the cleanup policies that were implemented. Cleanup was completed and all beaches except St. Guirec were in use by early July. Damages and costs incurred during cleanup exceeded $50 million.

The oil spread to East Bay, Tampa Bay and Hillsborough Bay and impacted 15 widely separated shorelines over a distance of approximately 20 miles. Personnel aboard the Howard Star failed to notify authorities of the discharge. The Coast Guard Marine Safety Office (MSO) Tampa was first notified by IMC on October 4 at 2025 that approximately 15 gallons of oil was in the water at the IMC terminal. The Coast Guard discovered large quantities of floating oil streaming into Hillsborough Bay from the Port Sutton Canal. The Environmental Coastal Pollution Cleanup Service (ECPCS) was notified of the spill and began mobilizing all available boom and cleanup equipment on October 5. An additional cleanup contractor, Need-A-Diver, was contracted by the Coast Guard. The Regional Response Team (RRT) was activated at 1115 on October 5, and the USCG Gulf Strike Team was requested. Because the entire transit system was affected, the port was closed to help contain the oil. The MSO and cleanup contractors deployed four sections of boom to prevent the oil from spreading further into the surrounding bays. By October 9, approximately 643 barrels of oil had been recovered by the contractors and the Coast Guard.

At the time of the accident, the storage facility at Hackberry contained roughly 14.2 million barrels of crude oil. During the removal of a well string for maintenance, the plug used to cap the well was released, sending drilling mud and crude oil out the top of the string. The low-flash point crude oil was ignited by nearby diesel engines and the resulting fire burned for five days. The release of 72,000 barrels of oil was initially contained within a containment dike. A breach of the dike the next day spilled 32,000 barrels of the oil into nearby Black Lake. Containment of the spill in the lake was accomplished with redundant tiers of boom. After the fire was extinguished, skimmers were used to recover the contained oil. Consistent winds and good weather greatly aided the recovery efforts.

Initially, only a small rainbow sheen, believed to be from deck machinery diesel and lube oil, was observed around the barge. Clean Water Inc. was contracted by Steuart Transportation, the barge owner, to stage pollution abatement equipment near the scene in the event of a spill during salvage operations. An underwater survey of the barge on February 4 reported no oil leaking from the barge, however, oil patches and light sheen were reported in the surrounding area on February 5. After the STC-101 was refloated on February 6 by the McLean Construction Company, the barge was intentionally grounded in Ingram Bay for dewatering operations. Extensive damage to the port side was discovered. Severe wind and weather conditions as well as poorly maintained and improperly secured cargo hatches may have contributed to the oil spillage. After the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Hampton Roads received several reports of oil and birds washing up on surrounding shorelines, a Federal spill was declared on February 8.

At 0045, the radar revealed an object approximately 9 miles away on the starboard side of the vessel. The Captain of the vessel claimed that he saw no navigational lights on the platform even though a Chevron spokesman said they were functioning properly. The mate failed to plot the object. At 0130, the port bow of the vessel struck the eastern side of the platform, opening up a gash 2 feet wide by the length of the bow tank. The cargo ignited and the fire spread towards 15 drums of lube oil. An emergency call was made and the ship was abandoned while fire and smoke engulfed the forward port section of the ship. Personnel working on other platforms in the area immediately responded to the accident. Six utility boats surrounded the Globtik Sun within 30 minutes. Two Coast Guard cutters and four aircraft arrived on-scene on August 15. The charred vessel was towed by McAllister Towing to Galveston on August 18. The Globtik Sun was later sold for scrap.

The Corinthos was in the process of offloading 315,000 barrels of Algerian crude oil at the British Petroleum terminal at Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania. The resulting explosion and fire reportedly shot flames 400-500 feet up into the air. The Corinthos ' hull split and sank, while continuing to smolder until February 6. The Edgar M. Queeny was carrying phenol, vinyl acetate, and paraffin at the time of the incident. Approximately 2,000 barrels of paraffin were released as a result of the impact. Twenty six of the forty-four people aboard the Corinthos lost their lives as a result of the collision, explosion, and fire. Although the Edgar M. Queeny also caught fire, no fatalities were reported on that vessel. Coast Guard personnel monitored the fire and pollution, controlled traffic and patrolled the security zone during the response. Pollution contractors were on scene within seventy-seven minutes of notification. Response personnel began booming creeks and wildlife areas immediately. Oiled waterfowl were taken to a cleaning facility at a New Jersey Armory. The Regional Response Team (RRT) was activated from January 31 through February 5. Coast Guard personnel from Marine Safety Office Philadelphia and the Atlantic Strike Team (AST) responded to the spill. Other response agencies included the Philadelphia City Fire Department, the U.S. Army, and the U.S. Navy. During 1976, the two sections of the sunken Corinthos were raised and towed to Camden, New Jersey to be scrapped. USCG district 1.

The master ordered water and cargo from the forward tank jettisoned to help get the vessel off the reef, so 37,579 barrels of crude oil were intentionally released. The master later stated that the gyro compass, radar and depth sounder were not working properly. No distress or notification calls were made, and the master initially insisted that no oil had been released. Winds were 18-19 knots, and seas were 1-1.5 feet. Oil started coming ashore on the beaches of Cabo Rojo, on the Bahia Sucia side, by the evening of the grounding. Efforts to minimize beach impacts began on March 19. These efforts involved booming, digging sumps, and pumping the collected oil into tank trucks. On March 21, a substantial number of sea cucumbers, conchs, prawns, sea urchins, and polychaete annelids washed ashore. Organisms were dying in the Thalassia beds off-shore as well. On March 23, the On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) activated the USCG Atlantic Strike Team (AST). Wind shifts had caused more shoreline oiling, and an increase in pumping capability was needed. After receiving training from the AST, Underwater Technics personnel manually cleaned beaches until April 26, when it was decided to leave the beaches alone since new sand was accumulating rapidly. An estimated 24,000 barrels impacted the shores of Cabo Rojo. The final site inspection was on September 24. USCG district 7.

The bow of the T/V Mayo Lykes, penetrated the port bow of the barge at a 45-60 degree angle, and almost cut the barge in two. Only the starboard outer skin of the barge held the vessel together. A large quantity of the 23,000 barrels of Louisiana crude oil and Bunker C spilled into the water upon impact. Later estimates reported 10,000 barrels of pollutant spilled into the water. Part of the spilled amount was released in the collision while the remainder leaked from the damaged tanks over the next several days. Weather conditions at the time of the accident were extremely adverse. Extensive fog, winds of 30-35 knots with 40 knot gusts, and seas of 3-4 feet hampered early containment attempts. Since the owner and operator of the damaged barge denied any responsibility in cleaning up the oil, U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) personnel began cleanup operations using the Oil Spill Contingency Fund. Brine Service Company was the primary cleanup contractor from March 12 until March 18 when Clean Channel Industries became the principal contractor, focusing on beach cleanup. After March 12, the USCG took on a strictly supervisory and monitoring role while contract personnel performed the actual cleanup. Two days after the spill, the local Audubon Society, with USCG assistance, collected and cleaned approximately 400 oil soaked Eared Grebes. The 320 surviving birds were released in an unpolluted area selected by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The Texas Department of Health, EPA Region 6, and Texas A&M University conducted ecological and pollutant studies in the affected area. Preliminary results showed little long-term adverse effect to the environment. Active cleanup continued until April 6 when the case officially closed, however cleaning on Atkinson and Bulkhead Reef Islands to the east of the Houston Ship Channel continued until the week of April 9.

The release resulted from heavy rains and flooding of the entire lagoon complex. Twelve to eighteen inches of rainfall from Hurricane Agnes on June 21-22 raised the Schuylkill River 20 feet over its banks and flooded the waste oil lagoons. Agnes proved to be the worst natural disaster in the U.S. at the time. Two billion dollars in damage and 100 fatalities were attributed to the storm. The spilled oil was not sighted until June 23, due to the more pressing concerns of evacuation and property damage. U.S. Coast Guard and Environmental Protection Agency personnel conducted an overflight of the area to assess the magnitude of the flood damage. Black oil and several hundred drums containing hazardous chemicals were spread over much of the countryside along the Schuylkill River. The Regional Response Team (RRT) was assembled and an on-scene coordinator was assigned by the EPA. The National Contingency Plan revolving fund was opened under the \"Act of God\" provision. On June 28, the Coast Guard National Strike Force and personnel from the Division of Oil and Hazardous Materials (DOHM) were called. The rains stopped on June 30. The top priorities at this point were to reduce the amount of oil leaching from the lagoons into the river and to protect the water intakes of downstream cities. On July 4, three main contractors, Underwater Technics, Clean Water, and New England Pollution Control were tasked with cleaning up a 16 mile stretch of the Schuylkill River. The spill area became a testing ground for clean-up methods. The bulk of the cleanup was completed by early August. By the conclusion of operations on September 30, the clean-up bill totaled $4.5 million. USCG district 1.

At the time of the incident the weather consisted of southwesterly gale force winds, overcast skies, heavy swells, and poor visibility. Only ten of the 34 crew members survived the accident. The stern section of the vessel sank after about two hours, while the bow section drifted southwest with the Agulhas Current. The bow was presumed to sink at 30 06 S, 031 54 E, approximately 40 miles from the initial breakup. All the ship's cargo, 334,043 barrels of Kuwait crude oil, eventually spilled into the Indian Ocean. The response was led by the Port Captain of Durban. Since the economy of Natal, South Africa, depended on the upcoming winter tourist season, the primary response goal was to keep the oil from impacting the mainly recreational shoreline. Dispersant operations were organized by personnel from the Department of Fisheries and the Department of Industries. Other parties involved in the response include the Department of Transportation, South African Defense Force, the Durban Corporation, the Oceanographic Research Institute, the Natal Anti-Shark Measures Board, and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.

The vessel was loaded with approximately 119,000 barrels of Venezuelan crude oil. The hull was severely damaged during the grounding causing the vessel to spill approximately 37,000 barrels of oil into the Atlantic Ocean at a location one and one-half miles offshore. Approximately 72,500 barrels of oil were pumped from the vessel into another tanker, the Esso Margarita. Steam lines were rigged to heat the cargo to facilitate pumping. Moving the salvage vessels into position and offloading the remaining cargo was performed during extremely severe weather. Dive surveys reported that the keel was crushed and buckled and that there was extensive damage to the hull of the vessel. Salvage and response personnel decided that the only feasible action was to sink the General Colocotronis. Following the offloading operations, the cargo tanks were flushed with dispersants to remove the residual oil. The vessel was then towed out to deep water and sunk. USCG district 7.

The Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy implemented an early warning system for oil movement. A panel of expert scientists was assembled to consider scientific problems involved with the cleanup procedure. Local authorities were instrumental in dealing with the oil beached within their jurisdictions. A detergent, primarily BP1002, was sprayed on much of the floating oil to emulsify and disperse it. Manual methods were used for removal of oil on many of the sandy beaches, although the dissected nature of the shoreline made it impossible to clean the whole coastline. The vessel lost structural integrity on March 26, releasing more oil into the water. Since towing the vessel off of the reef was deemed impossible, the government decided to bomb the vessel.
