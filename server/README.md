# Server Backend

This is the directory of the server, providing information to the frontend client (and any other API-calling users). The web server is backed by a Stardog triple store, from which it retrieves data through SPARQL queries.

## Installation

* Install dependencies with `yarn`
* Run the server with `yarn start`
* If you want to serve the latest frontend, run `yarn build-client` from this directory.
